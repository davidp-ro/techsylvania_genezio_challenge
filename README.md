## Previous Workflow

Essentially, my previous workflow hindered a few times troughout the day:
- In the morning, I lost time looking for some useful news & finding the right music to listen to.
- During the day, one thing that has always bothered me was figuring out regex :) and I constantly lost a lot of time figuring it out.

## Solution Description

Here comes _fling_ - I built this app in more or less 2-3 days (in between learning
for the almighty [bac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Baccalaureate)) and it's a dashboard that helps me with my daily workflow + some other nifty bits.

### Features
- **Regex** - A regex generator so I no longer have to look for it on StackOverflow
- **News** - Fetches some top stories from HackerNews
- **Music** - Embeds a Spotify playlist that I can listen in the morning
- **Recipes** - Lots and lots of suggestions so you don't have to think about what to cook
- **Passwords** - Ever needed a quick password? Well, here you go
- **Other** - Some bonus "non-interactive" activities that are good for you!

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend** - SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, daisyUI, Vite
- **Backend** - genezio!!, OpenAI

  Client deployed on Vercel, it wasn't 100% clear to me how to use genezio for the frontend, and I'm really tired at this point, sorry ü´∂
  <br />
  Backend fully on genezio.
